        <i>Indie rock</i>
      </p>
      <p class="w3-justify"> Originating in New Hampshire, the psych-rock outfit Marvel Prone formed in 2014. A year later, they placed top-ten in a high-school songwriting contest hosted by 92.5 FM “The River” Boston radio station, and their newest song “Nocturnal Life” aired on the radio. At the same time, they won a battle of bands at The Rochester Opera House, and were rewarded free studio time. Over the next year they recorded their first album Moonlightning, which was released in the Fall of 2016. The band then went through many different changes in line-up, which lead to Rainor Vigneault—the songwriter and leader of the band—to be the only original member. </p>
      <p class="w3-justify">The songs fall in the vein of great artists such as The White Stripes, The Strokes, with a touch of Tame Impala and Vampire Weekend. Rainor Vigneault, age 22, takes his influence from a lot of 2000's rock and popular music. The drummer Edward McPherson, age 19, is in love with prog-rock and metal from bands like Yes and Deafheaven. This shows through his technical and experimental drum- style. The bassist Lukas Labrie, age 30, draws inspiration from artists like RHCP and LCD Soundsystem. On top of that, Lukas has taken part in countless indie projects across New Hampshire. All this has made the band’s eclectic style well- pronounced and irresistible. Together, the band creates music that is new and exciting, but appealing to fans of many popular rock-styles of the past. </p>
      <p class="w3-justify">Marvel Prone performs across New Hampshire. Some of the venues they play include: The Stone Church Music Club in Newmarket; The Dover Brickhouse and Fury's Publick House; The Book N Bar and The Portsmouth Music and Arts Center. The band has played UNH Solarfest for three years in a row (2017-19), sharing bills with acts such as Lawrence, Vundabar, Harsh Armadillo, and Juice. We also played at Trichomania, an independently run music festival led by The Trichomes. On that we shared the bill with popular New-England jam bands such as Octave Cat, The Breakfast, and Barika. </p>
      <p class="w3-justify">Marvel Prone released their album She Hits Me on May 1st (peak-pandemic). On this record, dance-punk comes together with elements of metal, grunge, and psychedelic rock. Filled with upbeat grooves and driving guitars, the music demands attention. There are a lot of stand-out tracks on this album, one being “Last May”, an emo-Rock song about a dating-app love-affair. The other is “Blue-Eyes, White Dragon”, which is simultaneously an ode to the trading card game Yu-Gi-Oh! and a grunge-metal fused banger about reborn love. “Scrolling Through Your Feed” is a Pixies-Smiths-esque punk song centered around social media addiction. The last track of the album “Being-there” is an adventurous song about wanderlust, and never giving up after being rejected. </p>
      <p class="w3-justify">Along with their rambunctious energy, Marvel Prone carries an introspective quality to their aesthetic. This can lead the listener to question the state of society and what it means to love someone. The spirit of being “marvel-prone” is to chase a shooting star—even if it means diving into dark waters. </p>
